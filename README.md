What this program does:

To Run:

Ideas:
Currently the program is done. But as it currently is it is just a maze builder.
Things that one could add include a way to jump from room to room.
A save and load command. Add a way to toggle between design and play mode.
Create a way to make and place objects in rooms.
Create a type of mobile objects and allow them to move objects.
